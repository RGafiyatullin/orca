Right now it's a work in progress. What is currently supported can be seen in 'orca_testrun' module.

Usage:
	-include_lib("orca/include/orca.hrl").
	...
	{ok, Db} = orca:start_link( <<"mysql://root:rootpw@localhost/mysql?pool_size=4">> ),
	{ok, #orca_rows{ rows = Rows }} = orca:sql( <<"SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE ?">>, [ <<"innodb%">> ] ),
	...
